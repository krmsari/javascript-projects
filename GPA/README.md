>  The GPA Calculator project is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their Grade Point Average (GPA) based on the grades they received in their classes. It prompts the user to enter their grades and credit hours for each course, and then calculates their GPA based on the entered information.
  <br><br> The GPA is calculated using the standard formula: GPA = (total grade points) / (total credit hours). The grade points are calculated based on the letter grade the user entered for each course, according to a predefined grade point scale.
  <br> A "delete" button could be a useful feature to allow users to remove a previously entered course if they made a mistake or if they want to recalculate their GPA without including that course. The button be added as a separate element in the HTML code and styled using CSS.
