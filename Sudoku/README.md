# <h1 align="center" > Sudoku Game 

<div align="center">


>  The Sudoku game I developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS provides players with an interactive experience. Players strive to win the game by placing the correct numbers in the right cells. At the beginning of the game, randomly placed numbers provide players with a starting point and increase the difficulty of the game.<br><br> The game sends a congratulatory message to users when they win and notifies them of losing if they make five mistakes. Mistakes are counted when the user places incorrect numbers. <br><br>The game encourages users to be careful at every step. As a developer, this project has been an enjoyable opportunity to enhance my skills in software and game design
